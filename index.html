            <h1> -Revisiting my Childhood in Quarantine-
            </h1>
                
            <p>Being back at home in my childhood bedroom for the past few months has been both a blessing and a curse. While I am missing out on the typical “college experience” I hoped to cultivate at Berkeley after transferring from a community college, this experience has given me the opportunity to deepen my relationship with my family as we cope together through the anxiety of the pandemic.

                <p>As I enter adulthood, conversations with my parents have grown more personal and allowed for more honest, open dialogue about their own youth, their lives before my sister or I entered the picture, and their experiences raising my sister and I and planning to have children. </p>
                <p> My project is an auto-biogrpahy; however, my life has been most significantly shaped by my relationship with my parents and my parents’ own relationship with each other. </p>
                <p>My parents met in 1978 when my dad was finishing up his last years of college at San Francisco State. At the time, my mom was dating one of his friends. Though my mom has said it took her ten years to realize that she loved my father, my dad often says that he instantly thought she was “the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.” They were friends for ten years before they eventually decided to go on a date. By the time they dated, they had each married and subsequently divorced different people, had been roommates, and were ingrained in each others’ lives. </p>

                <p>My parents got married in 1990 at Swedenborgian Church in San Francisco, CA. They remembered playing old jazz and blue at their reception and being constantly surrounded by close friends and family. </p>

                <p>Eight years later they had me, and two years after that they had my sister. When I sat down to talk with them about raising my sister and I, we discussed their hesitations towards having children as well as their experiences raising my sister and I. While they were older than the average parent at the time they had my sister and I, were financially and emotionally ready to have children, and had taken full advantage of their freedom through travel and important life experiences, they were nervous about possibly passing down emotional and physical health issues to their children. Both of their sisters had died when they were young, my father’s sister as a result of mental illness and my mother’s sister from childhood cancer. However, once my mom discovered she was pregnant after trying for months, she was thrilled. </p>

        <p> These conversations and this project has helped me grow even closer to my family, and has helped us to lean against each other during a difficult time. Being back in my childhood home during quarantine, looking through old photographs, and learning about my parents’ past has helped me to reconnect with my childhood as well as bond with my parents. </p>
